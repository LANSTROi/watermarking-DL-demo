# watermarking-DL-demo
This repository contains the implementations for the watermarking project against adversarial attacks. I included a jupyter notebook to demonstrate how the components work.

Paper link: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/TCV/papers/Sun_A_Watermarking-Based_Framework_for_Protecting_Deep_Image_Classifiers_Against_Adversarial_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf

Dependencies: TensorFlow2, Cleverhans, pillow, opencv2, pywt and scipy. (It won't be hard to transfer this code to PyTorch)

I have included the most important components in the current version, however, I still need to clean up a bit more code so that I will keep updating this repository in the next few days.

It is very much a piece of research code. It is not very pythonic, and needs to be further optimized.

Just let me know if you have any questions.
